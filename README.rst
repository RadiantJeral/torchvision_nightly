The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision.

This repository generates torchvision_nightly based v0.2.3, which had been deleted officially. I build `.whl` file followed by [issue833](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/833) and [custom build](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/builds/custom-pip-builds/torchvision).

Build
=====
.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/RadiantJeral/torchvision_nightly.git

.. code:: bash

    cd vision

.. code:: bash

    rm -rf dist/* 

generate `.tar.gz` file

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py sdist

generate `.whl` file 

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py bdist_wheel 

check the output

.. code:: bash

    ls -l dist

.. code:: bash

    echo "Uploading dist/* to pypi" twine upload dist/*

Installation
============
Use pip online:
.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/RadiantJeral/torchvision_nightly.git

Anaconda:

.. code:: bash

    conda install torchvision_nightly-0.2.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl

pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install torchvision_nightly-0.2.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl


From source:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install


Image Backend
=============
Torchvision currently supports the following image backends:

* `Pillow`_ (default)

* `Pillow-SIMD`_ - a **much faster** drop-in replacement for Pillow with SIMD. If installed will be used as the default.

* `accimage`_ - if installed can be activated by calling :code:`torchvision.set_image_backend('accimage')`

.. _Pillow : https://python-pillow.org/
.. _Pillow-SIMD : https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd
.. _accimage: https://github.com/pytorch/accimage

Documentation
=============
You can find the API documentation on the pytorch website: http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/
